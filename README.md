# AngularTemplate

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

To run the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) directly your machine, execute the following command. This requires that Chrome is installed on your machine:

    $ npm test

To run the unit tests and generate code coverage reports, execute the following command. Reports will be output in the `coverage` directory as HTML, lcov, and cobertura formats. Cobertura is the format consumed by Jenkins for code coverage reporting. This requires that Chrome is installed on your machine:

    $ npm run test:coverage

To run the unit tests inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) container, execute the following command. This requires that Docker is running on your machine. All other dependencies are provided for you, thereby ensuring your local test environment exactly matches Jenkin's test environment:

    $ npm run test:docker

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
